# Predicting_Hotel_Cancellations_in_Portugal
This capstone project develops a machine learning model to predict whether customers are likely to cancel their hotel bookings at a Portuguese hotel. The project implements an end-to-end machine learning workflow, from data exploration and preprocessing to model development, evaluation, and deployment through an interactive Streamlit application.
